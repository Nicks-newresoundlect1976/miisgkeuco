Whoa. Just walked out of Demon City and my head is still swimming like itâ€™s doing the backstroke through gelatin. ðŸ˜µðŸ’¥ The theater was so loud my eardrums are probably on a roadtrip of their own, but wow was it worth it. The floor, sticky from oozy soda spills, felt like it was trying to eat my shoes. Gentleman next to me probably wore a whole cologne shop, but that's not the movie's fault, I guess. ðŸ¤¢

> So, the opening scene with the red moon over the crooked skyline and those weird, demonic clouds felt like I was inside a Magic Eye picture, squinting to find a hidden dinosaur but all I get is existential dread. Cinema's magic, huh? If only my back wasn't staging its own protest against the theater seats. They should hand out medals for surviving those.

There's this part where the hero, who looks like he's perpetually running late to catch a bus, goes full tilt down this endless alleywayâ€”kind of like me running through the rain trying to catch a sale. Somehow, the villain, a greasy eyebrow kinda dude, manages to stay sarcastic in all the chaos. Reminds me of my dog scowling when I forget his treats. Don't even get me started on the black cat that kept recurringâ€”like it had more plot than some entire movies. Feel like I shouldâ€™ve taken notes, but who brings a notebook when you're wrestling popcorn mid-wrestle?

Download the movie when you can, or better yet, actually wait, I think someone said watch the movie twice to catch all the hidden shenanigans. Just remember to take a cushion with you.

And the sound, oh boy, it's like an unhinged roller coaster: one minute the whispers are softer than moth wings, the next theyâ€™re slamming into you like a truckload of bricks covered in cymbals. Whoa, did I say that already? Guess I'm repeating like the looped nightmare soundtrack in my head.

Was that actor Tracy or Trevor... or maybe just a lucid fever dream with kung-fu skills? Didn't get a chance to check, too busy dodging flying popcorn missiles.ðŸŽ¥ Donâ€™t think anyone else noticed but there was definitely a weird parallel between the city's layout and my tangled thoughts on Monday mornings.

Now let's see, was it daylight when I walked inâ€”or umm... what was I gonna say?

public class DemonCity {
   void Watch() {
       Console.WriteLine(Chaos..);
       // Wait... this isn't the script?
       if (doesNotMakeSense()) {
          return void;
       }
   }
}

Anyway... what a trip.
